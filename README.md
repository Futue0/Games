# Games collection

1. No game engine. Very basic text adventure game. No external libraries or game engine used because only text required.
2. 2D using PyGame. Only single screen and no proper collision detection.
3. 2D using Pyglet. Still only single screen but does have very rudimentary platforming(!). There is a win condition although couldn't get the flag to register.
4. No game engine. Back to fantasy style 'text' adventure. Using tkinter for basic GUI navigation and to display text adventure contents. Trying mostly OOP (as also suitable).
